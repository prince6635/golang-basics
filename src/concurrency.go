Problem of concurrency: shared data
traditional languages' solutions: lock, mutex, semiphore

!!! Go's solution:
  Real world example: buying and eating eggs,
  In my own house, both me and my wife will bug eggs when find out no more eggs left, so it might end with both of us buying duplicate eggs.
  Use the solution in Go, I could say that I'll control the eggs. I'll be the one who looks at the eggs.
  I could tell my wife don't ever look at the eggs and decide that we're going to get eggs.
  I'll keep track of the eggs since I eat most of the eggs and I'm the one using them.
  I'll be the one who owns the eggs data. So I'll look at the egg and then, when we run low on eggs,
  and I know that you're at the store, I'm going to go ahead and use my cell phone and I'm going to call you and I'll ask you,
  can you get some eggs? This way you're never looking at the eggs and not knowing if I'm going to purchase the eggs and we don't end up with duplicate purchases of eggs.
  If I want to go out and get eggs because I see its low, then I'll do that and you won't have to worry about it.
  But, if I know that you're out at the store and we need more eggs, I'll let you know.
  So what I'm doing here is I'm basically taking control of that data. I'm no longer sharing the data.
  Instead what I'm doing is I'm using a communication channel to share information about that data versus using the data itself to communicate.
  And there's a big difference here when you think about that. It's really about who is in charge or what is controlling the actions.
  Before, the data itself was controlling the action, so the count of the eggs in the refrigerator was controlling my actions and my wife's actions as far as purchasing the eggs.
  But I changed that around and said, look, this communication is going to control the actions instead.

  How Go solves it:
  we're not going to try and share data. That's too messy.
  If you have multiple threads accessing the same data, it's bad.
  Instead of sharing the data at all, what we're going to do is we're going to communicate data so the data is not going to be the thing that we share.
  Instead, we're going to share a communication channel and we're going to talk about the data and I'm going to signal one thread to the other some information that is going to determine how that data gets manipulated.
  One thread in particular will own a piece of data and they'll communicate instead by a channel instead of using just the data to communicate.
  One thing that's often said of the Go language is that it's designed to enforce this principal.
  Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.
  And the emphasis is where the communication happens or what drives that communication, not the data.
  Instead we're going to share the data by communicating.
